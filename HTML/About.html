            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Our story began with a simple idea: to make our neighborhood a better place to live by promoting hygiene and health. What started as a small group of concerned residents has grown into a thriving community initiative. Over the years, we have organized numerous clean-up events, educational workshops, and health campaigns, all aimed at raising awareness and encouraging positive changes in our community. Our journey is fueled by the belief that every action, no matter how small, can contribute to a healthier, safer environment for all. We are proud of what we have accomplished so far and excited about the future as we continue to grow and make a difference.</p>
